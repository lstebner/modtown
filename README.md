This is a game/simulation of sorts that I like to think about a lot in my mind because of my past addictions to games like Tropico, Rollercoaster Tycoon and farming sims. It is an organic project that progresses randomly and has no real end point or final goals. 

I will spend some time eventually expanding this readme to be more informational but for now I just felt like I had to add something.

If you check out this project for yourself you just need a basic node setup and you can run the `app.js` to see what's going on. This is in debug mode currently and not really a "game" yet because I'm just building lots of "stuff".

That is all, enjoy.
